Client
======

:edb-alt-title: Client Library

This is the core client library, providing the main :ref:`createClient() <edgedb-dart-createClient>`
function for configuring a connection to an EdgeDB server, and the :ref:`Client <edgedb-dart-Client>`
class, which implements all the methods to run queries, work with
transactions, and manage other client state.

Parameters​
-----------

If your query contains parameters (e.g. ``$foo``), you can pass in values as
the second argument to all the ``execute()`` and ``query*()`` methods.

Named parameters are expected to be passed as a ``Map<String, dynamic>``, and
positional parameters as a ``List<dynamic>``.

.. code-block:: dart

    // Named parameters
    await client.execute(r'''insert Movie {
      title := <str>$title
    }''', {'title': 'Iron Man'});
    
    // Positional parameters
    await client.execute(r'''insert Movie {
      title := <str>$0
    }''', ['Iron Man']);
    
Remember that :ref:`parameters <ref_eql_params_types>`
can only be scalars or arrays of scalars.

Scripts​
--------

All the ``execute()`` and the ``query*()`` methods support scripts (queries
containing multiple statements). The statements are run in an implicit
transaction (unless already in an explicit transaction), so the whole
script remains atomic. For the ``query*()`` methods only the result of the
final statement in the script will be returned.

.. code-block:: dart

    final result = await client.query(r'''
      insert Movie {
        title := <str>$title
      };
      insert Person {
        name := <str>$name
      };
    ''', {
      'title': 'Thor: Ragnarok',
      'name': 'Anson Mount'
    });
    // [{id: "5dd2557b..."}]
    // Note: only the single item of the `insert Person ...`
    // statement is returned
    
For more fine grained control of atomic exectution of multiple statements,
use the :ref:`Client.transaction() <edgedb-dart-Client-transaction>` API.

Type Conversion
---------------

EdgeDB types are decoded into/encoded from Dart types as follows (any types
in parentheses are also valid for query parameters):

Custom types
------------

For EdgeDB types that don't have a built-in Dart type, we provide some
custom types:


* `LocalDateTime <https://pub.dev/documentation/edgedb/latest/edgedb/LocalDateTime-class.html>`__

* `LocalDate <https://pub.dev/documentation/edgedb/latest/edgedb/LocalDate-class.html>`__

* `LocalTime <https://pub.dev/documentation/edgedb/latest/edgedb/LocalTime-class.html>`__

* `RelativeDuration <https://pub.dev/documentation/edgedb/latest/edgedb/RelativeDuration-class.html>`__

* `DateDuration <https://pub.dev/documentation/edgedb/latest/edgedb/DateDuration-class.html>`__

* :ref:`Range <edgedb-dart-Range>`

* :ref:`ConfigMemory <edgedb-dart-ConfigMemory>`

EdgeDB errors
-------------

EdgeDB has a large range of type errors for fine-grained error handling,
with all exported error types inheriting from a base `EdgeDBError <https://pub.dev/documentation/edgedb/latest/edgedb/EdgeDBError-class.html>`__ type.
These are the main error types which are useful to watch out for (along
with their subtypes):


* `QueryError <https://pub.dev/documentation/edgedb/latest/edgedb/QueryError-class.html>`__: Errors relating to an issue with the query you're trying
  to run, such as syntax errors, or non-existant types/properties/links.

* `ExecutionError <https://pub.dev/documentation/edgedb/latest/edgedb/ExecutionError-class.html>`__: Runtime errors while running your query, such as
  cardinality violations.

* `ClientError <https://pub.dev/documentation/edgedb/latest/edgedb/ClientError-class.html>`__: Client side errors arising from incorrect arguments being
  passed to methods, etc.

* `AccessError <https://pub.dev/documentation/edgedb/latest/edgedb/AccessError-class.html>`__: The authentication details you provided were incorrect.

* `InternalServerError <https://pub.dev/documentation/edgedb/latest/edgedb/InternalServerError-class.html>`__: Ideally these should never happen; they indicate a
  bug in the EdgeDB server. It's useful if you can
  report these errors here: `github.com/edgedb/edgedb/issues <https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb/issues>`__
